    <h3>Simple example of using Mongoose.</h3>
    <p>This tutorial assumes you know JavaScript, and Node, and need to use
      Mongo for some sort of database application. At the bottom you will find
      further some useful links.  Please let me know if you discover errors,
      ommissions or other improvements that can be made.</p>

    <p class='cWarning'>Warning: the example code below must be run using Node.
      It will not work if you create a web page
      and include it as JavaScript using a &lt;script&gt; tag.</p>

      <p>It is assumed you have Mongo installed and know how to use <span class="cNPM">npm</span>.</p>
      <p>
        If you have not installed Mongo, here is what to do: If you have a PC, buy a Mac then go to
        <code class="cWebSite">brew.sh</code>. At the top of their site is a Ruby script that invokes
        <code class="cCommand">curl</code>.  Next, copy this script, paste and run it in a Bash shell
        and continue by using the shell commands below.</p>
        <code class="cShell">/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl ...</code><br><br>
        <code class="cShell">brew install mongodb</code>
        <p>  Did you notice that little
          "db" at the end of the command? It's important. Now run:</p>
          <code class="cShell">mongod</code>
          <p>Did you notice that "d" at the end of that command?  It's important too.</p>

          <p>Mongo should be running.  If you don't know if Mongo is running, use this
            Bash shell command: </p>
            <code class="cShell">mongo</code>
            <p>Did you notice this command did
              <i>not</i> have a "d" or a "db" suffix? </p>
              <p>Now your are ready to install
                Mongoose from <span class='cNPM'>npm<span>.</p>
                  <code class="cShell">npm install --save mongoose</code>
                  <p>And finally, create test.js with this code:</p>
                  <pre>
  'use strict'

  var mongoose = require("mongoose")

  mongoose.connect(“mongodb://localhost/dbName”) // Default port is 27017

  // Create a MODEL with simple schema
  // This step is also known as Compiling a schema into a model
  mongoose.model(“MyModelClass”, {name: String, birthday: Date})

  // Create an INSTANCE of the model.
  // Initial values are passed as an object.
  // Notice the populated instance was returned and saved as "var modelInstance".
  // The model class serves as a constructor when creating new instances
  // of the model (which, in turn, will then be added to the collection of
  // instances in the DB)
  var modelInstance = new MyModelClass({name: “Todd", birthday:"11-11-11"})

  // SAVE the instance (of model)
  // i.e. add model to the "collection" which
  // is an array with only one member (as of now)
  modelInstance.save(function(err) {
    if (err) {
      console.log()
    } else {
      console.log()
    }
  })
                  </pre>

                  <p>Inside Mongo, there is now a <i>collection</i> which is an
                    array of "ModelName" instances--each of which has this form:<br>
                    <code>{name: xxx, birthday: Date }</code></p>

                    <p>"ModelClass" is a poor choice of names.  For this case,
                      it would have been better to use a descriptive
                      name like "Person" or possibly "PersonModel".</p>
                    <p>By convention, model names start in upper-case letters and
                      <i>instances</i> of models are start with lower-case letters.</p>

                    <p>By now, there may be some confusion or fuzziness as to what did (or did not) happen after running
                    this code in Node.  First, let me remind you that Mongo (<code>mongod</code>) had to be running <em>before</em>
                  executing the test code. </p>
                  <b>Robomongo</b>
                  <p>You will notice that the Node program did not show any
                    signs of exiting (or even
                completing its task).  So, next, I suggest you install Robomongo
                to see what is going on inside the Mongo DB.
              There are other ways to do this, but I have been told Robomongo is
              the best-and I not spent any time trying to disprove this.</p>
              <p>Robomongo is not perfect.  In fact, I have not found a way to
                automatically refresh its view when new data comes in.
              Also, if you happen to close the window, Robomongo goes away
              altogether, because it is not being run like a normal desktop app.</p>
              <p>Oh, and one other thing: there is no documentation provided with Robomongo.
                Maybe that's because they only received 25% of their crowd-funding target?</p>
<b>Reading from Mongo</b>
<p>It turns out, you need a Model Class to read from a model (collection) in Mongo. You
  might have noticed that creating an instance of a model returns a Model Class.
  But what if you wanted to read data (without adding data just to get the Model Class?).
To obtain a Model Class issue: <code>var myModelInstance = mongoose.model('SomeModel'</code>
<p>So far we put something into Mongo, but it's now time to read back (query) what is inside.
There are many ways to do this, but we will only discuss a couple of easy ones:</p>
<p>First, there is the .find() method on the Model. When I say "Model" I mean the model class.
Recall that to obtain a model this is used: var PeopleModel = new PeopleModel()
